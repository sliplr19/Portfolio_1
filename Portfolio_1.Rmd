In this portfolio piece, we will look at how people's relationship to cooking and baking has changed pre- and during Covid. Let's load some data!

```{r setup, warning = FALSE}
library(readxl)
Cooking <- read_excel("G:/My Drive/DataScience/Covid/Cooking.xlsx")
```

This data is messy. Let's make it tidy! (well, kind of. The rows will be means rather than observations....so maybe it won't be totally tidy)
